I am currently an Assistant Professor in Colledge of Civil and Transportation Engineerig at Shenzhen University. I am working in the Institute of Urban Smart Transportation & Safety Maintenance, and leaded by Academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering Yanliang Du. I received my Ph.D degree in Transportation Engineering from Southeast University advised by Prof. Bin Ran.

I am interested in the intersection between machine learning and transportation.
