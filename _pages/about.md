I am currently an Assistant Professor in Colledge of Civil and Transportation Engineerig at Shenzhen University. I am working in the Institute of Urban Smart Transportation & Safety Maintenance, and leaded by Academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering Yanliang Du. I received my Ph.D degree in Transportation Engineering from Southeast University advised by Prof. Bin Ran.  
The intelligent sensing of human, vehicle, infrastrcture, and enviroment and effective data mining are fundamentals of the intelligent transportation system (ITS). It is necessary to apply advanced sensors and develop new models to improve the safety, intelligence, and resilience of the system. Towards this goal, I work on crowdsourcing solution and signal processing for ITS and developing new algorithms based on machine learning, tensor decomposition, and optimization for temporal and spatial data. My research papers have been cited more than 900 times on Google Scholar and the research findings fortunately received several awards. 

## üë¶ For Prospective Students/Postdocs
* I am looking for one motivated Postdoc in 1) Urban computing, 2) Intelligent transportation systems, 3) Temporal and spatial data modeling. Please send me an email with your CV, a brief research statement (one page or less) and transcripts.
* I am looking for master students for Fall'23 who are excited about sensing and computing for intelligent transportation system. If you are interested, welcome to take a look and <a href = "mailto: lilinchao@szu.edu.cn">contact me</a>.
